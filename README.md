# AWS Athena CLI

A command-line interface tool written in Rust for interacting with AWS Athena, providing a streamlined experience similar to the Athena web console.

## Purpose

- Execute SQL queries against AWS Athena databases
- List and manage workgroups
- View query history and results
- Manage databases and tables
- Save frequently used queries

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Rust installed (1.70 or later)
2. Clone this repository
3. Run `cargo install --path .`
4. Copy `config.example.toml` to `~/.config/athena-cli/config.toml` and update with your settings

## Usage

### Basic commands:
- `athena-cli query "SELECT * FROM table"` - Execute a query
- `athena-cli workgroup list` - List available workgroups
- `athena-cli db list` - List databases

### Configuration

- AWS credentials (if not using AWS CLI configuration)

## Requirements

- AWS account with Athena access
- Configured AWS credentials
- Rust 1.70+

For detailed documentation and examples, see the [Wiki](link-to-wiki).
